- Hi, I’m a mathematician with expertise in probability theory. I am also interested in data science and machine learning problems, as well as mathematical and computational modeling in science and engineering.

- The (current) goal of this page is to keep a portfolio of some of my work in data science and provide a point of contact to future employers and others with similar interest. You can visit my Linkedin profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/humberto-sanna-348bb1208/).
